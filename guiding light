<p>Credits to LSPLASH </p> <p> The Guiding Light actually has no official name. The origin of the entity's name comes from the name of the death screen background music "Guiding Light". Even the developers have begun to refer to the entity as the Guiding Light, however.
The Guiding Light is the only helpful entity as of now.
Besides only appearing in Dark Rooms, the Library, the Painting Puzzle Room and Seek's chase sequences, the Guiding Light does not appear anywhere else in-game.
There are multiple variations of the same death message (e.g., dying to Seek's hands and Figure's minigame.)
The official soundtrack used for Death Messages is Guiding Light, which it is called because of its name.
In the doors hotel+ sneak peek, the candle flame turned blue, presumably hinting that guiding light can manifest into a candle flame
KreekCraft had a unique death message on a DOORS Livestream. The message said: ‘What... the heck... just happened? I think something’s wrong… Sorry about that, Kreek.’
During the stream, KreekCraft was being trolled by the developers, such as Screech appearing constantly, several instances of Ambush appearing, and A-60 (an entity from the game Rooms, which is one of the games DOORS was inspired by) can be seen moving through the doorway with a red glow and a noticeably different sound than Rush and Ambush. This has only been confirmed as a troll by the Developers therefore A-60 is not an official entity and is not part of the game lore.
If the player dies to Glitch, the Guiding Light is unable to determine who they died to.
This is due to Glitch being non-canon.
The texture for the Guiding Light particle was originally called "sanseyelol".
This also happens to be the texture for Halt's eyes.
It was later renamed to "why are you guys commenting on this", with the description called “bro…”.
Wowzers has confirmed that Guiding Light will never get an achievement in-game.[1]
A glitch existed in which the Guiding Light would appear at Door 1.[2] </p>
